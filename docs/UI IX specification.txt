complete copy of the specification for your records. Here is the full UI/UX Specification for PharmC that we created together.

PharmC UI/UX Specification
Version: 1.0
Date: July 21, 2025

1. Overall UX Goals & Principles
Target User Personas
The Busy Professional: Values speed and efficiency.

The Patient with Mobility Challenges: Needs a simple, accessible, and stress-free interface.

The Caregiver: Requires tools to manage complex tasks for others easily and without error.

Usability Goals
Ease of Learning: A new user, including one with limited technical skills, should be able to successfully submit their first prescription in under 5 minutes.

Efficiency: A returning caregiver should be able to manage a refill for a dependent in under 60 seconds.

Trust & Confidence: The design must feel secure and professional, giving users peace of mind that their sensitive health information is safe and their order is being handled correctly.

Design Principles
Clarity First: We will always prioritize clear, simple language and unambiguous interfaces over clever or trendy design.

Progressive Disclosure: We'll show users only the information they need at each step to reduce complexity and cognitive load.

Provide Constant Feedback: Every tap and click will have an immediate and clear system response, so the user always knows what's happening.

Design for Trust: The visual design will be clean, professional, and transparent, reinforcing that PharmC is a reliable healthcare service.

2. Information Architecture (IA)
Site Map / Screen Inventory

    B --> C[Patient/Caregiver Portal];
    B --> D[Doctor Portal];
    B --> E[Pharmacist Portal];

        C -- Primary Nav --> C2[New Prescription Flow];
        C -- Primary Nav --> C3[Order History];
        C -- Primary Nav --> C4[Profile Management];
        C1 --> C1a[Order Status & Tracking];
        C4 --> C4a[Dependent Profile Mgmt];
    end

    subgraph Doctor Portal
        D -- Primary Nav --> D1[Dashboard/Patient List];
        D -- Primary Nav --> D2[Submit New Prescription];
        D -- Primary Nav --> D3[Profile];
    end

    subgraph Pharmacist Portal
        E -- Primary Nav --> E1[Prescription Queue];
        E -- Primary Nav --> E2[Order Fulfillment];
        E -- Primary-Nav --> E3[Profile];
    end
Navigation Structure
Primary Navigation (Patient/Caregiver): A main bottom tab bar on mobile (Dashboard, New Order, History, Profile) and a primary header navigation on the web.

Primary Navigation (Doctor & Pharmacist Portals): A persistent sidebar on the web with links to their main tasks.

Breadcrumb Strategy: Breadcrumbs will be used on the web portals to help users easily navigate back through complex views.

3. User Flows
Flow: New Prescription Order
User Goal: To quickly and successfully submit a new prescription for verification and payment.

Success Criteria: The user's prescription is submitted to the pharmacist queue, and the user receives clear confirmation.

Flow Diagram:

    A[Start] --> B[User taps 'New Order'];
    B --> C{Is user a<br>Caregiver with<br>multiple profiles?};
    C -->|Yes| D[Select Patient Profile];
    C -->|No| E[Choose Upload Method];
    D --> E;
    E --> F[Capture or Select Image];
    F --> G[User Confirms Upload];
    G --> H((AI OCR Processing));
    H --> I[Show Extracted Data to User];
    I --> J{User Choice};
    J -->|Edit / Confirm Details| K[User Submits Confirmed Data];
    J -->|Skip & Send Directly| L[User Submits Image Only];
    K --> M[End: Order in Pharmacist Queue];
    L --> M;
Edge Cases: Handle blurry images, upload failures, and OCR failures gracefully.

4. Wireframes & Mockups
Primary Design Files: This specification will serve as the brief for high-fidelity mockups. The final designs will be created in a professional tool like Figma, and the project will be linked from here.

Key Screen Layouts (Conceptual)
Patient/Caregiver Dashboard: Header with profile switcher, a prominent "Submit a New Prescription" button, a list of active orders with their statuses, and a section for reminders.

Prescription Upload Screen: A large camera viewfinder with simple controls (Take Photo, Flash, Upload from Library) and a clear image preview step.

5. Component Library / Design System
Approach: We will use a Pre-built Component Library (e.g., Material-UI, Chakra UI) and customize its theme to match our brand. This is the fastest approach for an MVP.

Core Components: The library must provide consistent, accessible components for Buttons, Input Fields, Cards, and Navigation (Tab Bars/Sidebars).

6. Branding & Style Guide
Visual Identity: Modern, clean, and calming to convey professionalism and security.

Color Palette: A primary blue (#2667FF) with neutral grays, and semantic colors for success (green), warning (amber), and error (red).

Typography: "Inter" (from Google Fonts) for its high readability and French character support.

Iconography: Feather Icons library for a clean, modern, and consistent look.

Spacing & Layout: An 8-point grid system to ensure consistent spacing and alignment.

7. Accessibility Requirements
Standard: We will adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at the Level AA standard.

Key Requirements: This includes ensuring high color contrast, full keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, large touch targets, and proper use of alt text and form labels.

Testing Strategy: A mix of automated tools, manual checks, and user testing with people with disabilities.

8. Responsiveness Strategy
Breakpoints: A standard three-breakpoint system for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.

Adaptation Patterns: The layout will adapt from a single column on mobile to a multi-column grid on larger screens. Navigation will transform from a mobile tab bar to a web sidebar/header.

9. Animation & Micro-interactions
Principles: All animation will be purposeful, quick, and consistent to enhance the user experience, not distract from it.

Key Animations: Subtle effects for page transitions, button feedback, loading indicators, and success/error states.

10. Performance Considerations
Goals: Target an LCP of under 2.5 seconds on mobile, instant UI response (<100ms), and smooth 60 FPS animations.

Strategies: Use of skeleton loaders during data fetching, automatic image optimization, and lazy loading of non-essential content.

11. Next Steps
Immediate Actions: Final stakeholder review, handoff to the Architect, and the start of high-fidelity visual design in Figma.

Handoff Checklist: All sections required for the next phase are complete and validated.
