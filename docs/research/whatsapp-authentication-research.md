# WhatsApp Business API Authentication Research

## Executive Summary

This research investigates the feasibility of implementing "Sign in with WhatsApp" functionality for PharmaRx's authentication system. Based on comprehensive analysis of WhatsApp Business API capabilities, technical requirements, costs, and business considerations, this document provides findings and recommendations for future implementation.

**Key Finding**: WhatsApp Business API does not provide traditional OAuth-style "Sign in with WhatsApp" authentication comparable to Google/Facebook social logins. Instead, it offers authentication templates for OTP-based verification that could complement our existing Firebase Auth system.

## 1. WhatsApp Business API Authentication Capabilities

### 1.1 Available Authentication Methods

WhatsApp Business API provides **Authentication Templates** for one-time password (OTP) and verification code delivery:

#### Authentication Template Features:
- **One-Time Passcodes**: Send OTPs for user verification
- **Account Verification**: Identity verification for new accounts
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Additional security layer for existing users
- **Password Reset**: Secure password reset flows

#### Template Types:
1. **One-Tap Autofill** (Android only): Automatically fills OTP in app
2. **Copy Code**: Users can copy code to clipboard
3. **Zero-Tap**: Direct OTP broadcasting to app without user interaction

### 1.2 Authentication Flow Structure

**Current WhatsApp Authentication Flow:**
```
1. User requests OTP ‚Üí Business App
2. Business App ‚Üí WhatsApp Business API (sends auth template)
3. WhatsApp delivers OTP ‚Üí User's WhatsApp
4. User manually enters OTP ‚Üí Business App
5. Business App validates OTP ‚Üí Authentication complete
```

### 1.3 Limitations for Traditional Social Login

**What WhatsApp API Cannot Provide:**
- Direct OAuth 2.0 social login flow
- User profile information retrieval
- Seamless "Sign in with WhatsApp" button experience
- Direct account linking without OTP verification
- Access to user's WhatsApp contacts or data
