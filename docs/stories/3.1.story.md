## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from Story 2.6 implementation:
- Service Layer Design patterns with clean method interfaces work well
- Shared types package ensures consistency across frontend/backend boundaries
- Real-time notification patterns established with polling every 15-30 seconds
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation is expected
- Excellent testing architecture with mocking strategies should be followed

### Data Models
**Order Status Values** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#36]:
```typescript
status: 'pending_verification' | 'awaiting_payment' | 'preparing' | 'out_for_delivery' | 'delivered' | 'rejected'
```
- Story will use 'preparing' and 'out_for_delivery' status values
- Status updates include updatedAt timestamp field

### API Specifications
**Existing Status Update Endpoint** [Source: apps/api/src/features/prescriptionOrderRoutes.ts#175]:
- Endpoint: `PUT /orders/:orderId/status`
- Request body: `{ status: PrescriptionOrderStatus }`
- Validates status against allowed values including 'preparing' and 'out_for_delivery'
- Updates order with new status and updatedAt timestamp
- Returns updated order data with success response

### Component Specifications
**Pharmacist Queue Component** [Source: apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/PharmacistQueue.tsx]:
- Located at `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/PharmacistQueue.tsx`
- Uses `usePharmacistQueue` hook with auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- Has `updateOrderInQueue` callback for real-time updates
- Displays orders in table format with Review button leading to PrescriptionReview

**PrescriptionReview Component** [Source: apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/PrescriptionReview.tsx]:
- Component where status update buttons should be added
- Already displays order details and OCR results
- Integration point for new status update functionality

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]:
- **Backend Routes**: `apps/api/src/features/prescriptionOrderRoutes.ts` (existing endpoint, no changes needed)
- **Frontend Components**: 
  - `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/PrescriptionReview.tsx` (main component to modify)
  - `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/PharmacistQueue.tsx` (may need updates for real-time refresh)
- **Hooks**: `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/hooks/usePharmacistQueue.ts` (existing, may need updates)
- **Types**: `packages/shared-types/src/` (existing types sufficient)
- **Services**: `apps/web/src/services/prescriptionService.ts` (may need status update method)

### Testing Requirements
Following established patterns [Source: Story 2.6 testing architecture]:
- **Unit Tests**: Component testing with mocking strategies for API calls
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing with proper error scenarios
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user flow testing with Playwright
- **Test Files**: Co-located `.test.ts` files (e.g., `PrescriptionReview.test.tsx`)

### Technical Constraints
**Real-time Updates** [Source: apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/hooks/usePaymentNotification.ts#86]:
- Use existing polling mechanism with TanStack Query
- 15-30 second polling intervals established as standard
- `refetchInterval` and `refetchIntervalInBackground` patterns to follow

**Tech Stack Constraints** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: React 18.3 with TypeScript 5.4, Tailwind CSS for styling
- State Management: TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for global UI state
- Testing: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript, Google Firestore database

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test File Locations** [Source: established patterns]:
- Unit tests: Co-located with components (e.g., `PrescriptionReview.test.tsx`)
- Integration tests: `apps/api/src/features/prescriptionOrderRoutes.test.ts` (existing file to extend)
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/` directory

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for critical user flows
- **Mocking**: Comprehensive API mocking strategies as demonstrated in Story 2.6

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Test status update button functionality with loading/error states
- Mock API responses for both success and failure scenarios  
- Test real-time queue updates when status changes
- E2E test for complete pharmacist status update workflow
- Test user visibility of status changes in patient portal

## Dev Agent Record
*Implementation completed by James (Full Stack Developer)*

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 - Full Stack Developer Agent

### Debug Log References  
No critical issues encountered during implementation. All components integrated seamlessly with existing architecture.

### Completion Notes List
- **Status Update UI**: Added comprehensive status update buttons to ReviewActions component with proper confirmation dialogs, loading states, and error handling
- **API Integration**: Successfully integrated with existing PUT /orders/:orderId/status endpoint using updated prescription service
- **Real-time Updates**: Extended existing polling mechanisms with new useOrderStatus hook and created OrderStatusDisplay component for comprehensive status visualization
- **Testing**: Created comprehensive unit tests for ReviewActions status updates and OrderStatusDisplay component covering all status types and edge cases
- **User Experience**: Implemented intuitive UI flow where pharmacists see status update buttons only when appropriate (awaiting_payment → preparing → out_for_delivery)
- **Real-time Feedback**: Orders automatically disappear from pharmacist queue when status changes, and users see real-time status updates through polling

### File List
