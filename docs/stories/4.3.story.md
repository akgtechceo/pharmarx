```

### API Specifications
**Inventory API Endpoints** [Source: docs/architecture/api-spec.md#patterns]:
- `GET /api/inventory/items` - Query inventory items with filters
- `GET /api/inventory/pharmacies` - Get pharmacy locations and status
- `POST /api/inventory/sync` - Trigger manual inventory sync
- `GET /api/inventory/health` - Check pharmacy integration health

**External Pharmacy API Integration** [Source: Previous story patterns]:
- Follow established OCR service pattern for external API integration
- Use configuration-based approach for multiple pharmacy systems
- Implement adapter pattern for different pharmacy API formats
- Add comprehensive retry logic and circuit breaker patterns
- Include health checks and monitoring for each pharmacy integration

### Component Specifications
**Backend Service Architecture** [Source: apps/api/src/features/ocrService.ts#patterns]:
- Create `InventoryService` class following OCR service pattern
- Implement pharmacy-specific adapters (e.g., `PharmacyAAdapter`, `PharmacyBAdapter`)
- Use configuration management similar to GCP config pattern
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Implement health check methods for each pharmacy integration

**Frontend Integration** [Source: Previous story patterns]:
- Create inventory query hooks using TanStack Query
- Implement pharmacy location mapping components
- Add inventory status indicators and availability displays
- Create inventory sync monitoring dashboard for pharmacists

### File Locations

- `apps/api/src/features/inventoryRoutes.ts` - API routes for inventory queries and sync
- `apps/api/src/features/pharmacyAdapters/` - Pharmacy-specific API adapters
- `apps/api/src/config/inventoryConfig.ts` - Inventory and pharmacy configuration management
- `apps/api/src/features/inventoryService.test.ts` - Unit tests for inventory service
- `apps/api/src/features/inventoryRoutes.test.ts` - Integration tests for inventory API

**Frontend Implementation** [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]:

- `apps/web/src/features/inventory/services/` - Frontend service layer for inventory API
- `apps/web/src/features/pharmacist/components/InventoryDashboard.tsx` - Pharmacist inventory management

**Shared Types** [Source: packages/shared-types/src/index.ts]:
- Add InventoryItem, PharmacyLocation, InventoryQueryRequest types
- Add inventory status enums and pharmacy integration types
- Extend existing PrescriptionOrder model for inventory availability

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing Strategy** [Source: Previous story patterns]:
- Test inventory service with mocked pharmacy API responses
- Test pharmacy adapters with various API formats and error scenarios
- Test configuration management and validation
- Mock external pharmacy APIs for reliable testing

**Integration Testing** [Source: Previous story patterns]:
- Test inventory API endpoints with authentication and authorization
- Test pharmacy integration health checks and monitoring
- Test inventory sync workflows and error handling
- Test API downtime scenarios and fallback behavior

**E2E Testing** [Source: Previous story patterns]:
- Complete inventory query workflow from prescription to availability
- Test pharmacy location mapping and selection
- Test inventory sync monitoring and alerts
- Test integration with existing prescription workflow

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Considerations** [Source: Previous story patterns]:
- Implement caching for inventory data with 5-minute stale time
- Use TanStack Query with background refetch for real-time updates
- Add request debouncing for inventory queries
- Implement pagination for large inventory datasets

**Security Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/api-spec.md]:
- Pharmacist role verification for inventory management endpoints
- Secure API key storage for pharmacy integrations
- Audit logging for inventory queries and sync operations
- Rate limiting for external pharmacy API calls

**External API Integration Patterns** [Source: apps/api/src/features/ocrService.ts#patterns]:
- Follow established retry logic with exponential backoff
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for API downtime handling
- Use configuration-based approach for multiple pharmacy systems
- Add comprehensive health checks and monitoring
- Include proper error handling and graceful degradation

### Project Structure Notes
The implementation follows the established monorepo structure with clear separation between frontend and backend. Pharmacy inventory functionality will be a new feature module under `apps/web/src/features/inventory/` following the existing pattern established by other features. The backend will add new routes under `apps/api/src/features/inventoryRoutes.ts` following the established Express.js patterns. The existing PharmacistPortal component will be enhanced with inventory management capabilities, maintaining the current professional interface while adding real-time inventory data and pharmacy integration monitoring.
