## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from Story 4.1 implementation:
- TanStack Query patterns with `refetchInterval` and `refetchIntervalInBackground` are the standard
- Service Layer Design patterns with clean method interfaces should be followed
- Shared types package ensures consistency across frontend/backend boundaries
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation is expected
- Excellent testing architecture with mocking strategies should be followed
- Portal-based architecture with role-specific components is well established
- Profile management patterns can be adapted for patient search functionality

### Data Models
**User Model** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#1]:
```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  role: 'patient' | 'caregiver' | 'doctor' | 'pharmacist';
  email?: string;
  phoneNumber?: string;
  displayName: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

**PatientProfile Model** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#12]:
```typescript

### API Specifications
**New API endpoints** for doctor prescription workflow [Source: docs/architecture/api-spec.md extension]:
- `GET /doctor/patients` - Search for registered patients by name, phone, or email
- `POST /doctor/prescriptions` - Submit new prescription for a patient
- `GET /doctor/prescriptions` - Get doctor's prescription history
- `POST /notifications/prescription` - Send notification to patient about new prescription

**Authentication & Authorization** [Source: docs/architecture/api-spec.md]:
- All endpoints require Firebase ID token authentication
- Doctor role verification required for all doctor endpoints
- Patient search limited to patients registered in the system
- Prescription submissions create PrescriptionOrder records with 'pending_verification' status

### Component Specifications
**Doctor Portal Structure** following project patterns [Source: apps/web/src/App.tsx#127]:
```
apps/web/src/features/doctor/
├── components/
│   ├── PatientSearch.tsx
│   ├── PatientSearchResults.tsx
│   ├── PrescriptionForm.tsx
│   ├── PrescriptionHistory.tsx
│   └── DoctorPrescriptionPortal.tsx
├── hooks/
│   ├── usePatientSearch.ts
│   ├── usePrescriptionSubmission.ts
│   └── usePrescriptionHistory.ts
├── services/
│   └── doctorPrescriptionService.ts
└── types/
    └── doctor.types.ts
```

**Integration with Existing DoctorPortal** [Source: apps/web/src/App.tsx#127]:
- Extend existing DoctorPortal component in App.tsx
- Add prescription submission section to the existing dashboard layout
- Integrate with existing patient management and clinical tools sections
- Maintain consistent styling with blue color scheme and professional layout

### File Locations
**Backend Implementation** [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]:
- `apps/api/src/features/doctorPrescriptionRoutes.ts` - New API routes for doctor prescription workflow
- `apps/api/src/features/doctorPrescriptionService.ts` - Service layer for doctor prescription logic
- `apps/api/src/features/notificationService.ts` - Enhanced notification service for prescription alerts

**Frontend Implementation** [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]:
- `apps/web/src/features/doctor/components/` - All doctor-specific components
- `apps/web/src/features/doctor/hooks/` - Custom hooks for doctor functionality
- `apps/web/src/features/doctor/services/` - Service layer for doctor API calls
- `apps/web/src/App.tsx` - Update existing DoctorPortal component

**Shared Types** [Source: packages/shared-types/src/index.ts]:
- Add DoctorPrescriptionSubmission, PatientSearchResult, and related types
- Extend existing PrescriptionOrder model for doctor submissions
- Add notification types for prescription alerts

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing Strategy** [Source: Previous story patterns]:
- Test PatientSearch component with mock patient data
- Test PrescriptionForm validation and submission logic
- Test usePatientSearch and usePrescriptionSubmission hooks
- Mock API responses and error scenarios

**Integration Testing** [Source: Previous story patterns]:
- Test complete prescription submission workflow
- Test patient search with various query types
- Test notification delivery for different patient contact methods
- Test doctor authorization and access controls

**E2E Testing** [Source: Previous story patterns]:
- Complete doctor prescription submission flow
- Patient notification receipt and response
- Integration with existing pharmacist verification workflow

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Considerations** [Source: Previous story patterns]:
- Implement debounced search with 300ms delay for patient search
- Use TanStack Query with 5-minute stale time for patient data
- Background refetch every 30 seconds for prescription status updates
- Optimistic updates for prescription submission workflow

**Security Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/api-spec.md]:
- Doctor role verification on all prescription endpoints
- Patient data access limited to registered patients only
- Secure notification delivery with delivery confirmation
- Audit logging for all prescription submissions

### Project Structure Notes
The implementation follows the established monorepo structure with clear separation between frontend and backend. Doctor prescription functionality will be a new feature module under `apps/web/src/features/doctor/` following the existing pattern established by the prescriptions and profiles features. The backend will add new routes under `apps/api/src/features/doctorPrescriptionRoutes.ts` following the established Express.js patterns. The existing DoctorPortal component in App.tsx will be enhanced rather than replaced, maintaining the current professional clinical interface while adding the new prescription submission capabilities.
