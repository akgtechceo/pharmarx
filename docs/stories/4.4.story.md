## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from Story 4.3 implementation:
- Pharmacy inventory integration layer established with adapter pattern
- Real-time inventory querying with TanStack Query for caching
- Comprehensive error handling with retry logic and circuit breakers
- Pharmacy location data models and API endpoints already available
- Health monitoring and configuration management for pharmacy integrations
- Shared types package ensures consistency across frontend/backend boundaries

### Data Models
**PharmacyLocation Model** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#patterns]:
```typescript
interface PharmacyLocation {
  pharmacyId: string;
  name: string;
  address: {
    street: string;
    city: string;
    state: string;
    postalCode: string;
    country: string;
  };
  coordinates: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
  };
  contactInfo: {
    phone: string;
    email?: string;
  };
  operatingHours: {
    open: string;
    close: string;
    daysOpen: string[];
  };
  isAvailable: boolean;
}
```

**InventoryItem Model** [Source: Story 4.3 implementation]:
```typescript
interface InventoryItem {
  itemId: string;
  pharmacyId: string;
  medicationName: string;
  genericName?: string;
  dosage: string;
  form: 'tablet' | 'capsule' | 'liquid' | 'injection' | 'cream' | 'other';
  strength: string;
  quantity: number;
  unit: 'tablets' | 'capsules' | 'bottles' | 'tubes' | 'vials' | 'units';
  price: number;
  currency: string;
  lastUpdated: Date;
  isAvailable: boolean;
  expiryDate?: Date;
}
```

**Map Pharmacy Data Model** [Source: Story 4.3 patterns]:
```typescript
interface MapPharmacyData {
  pharmacy: PharmacyLocation;
  inventoryItems: InventoryItem[];
  distance: number; // Distance from user location
  estimatedDeliveryTime: number; // Minutes
  isPreferred: boolean; // Based on user preferences
}
```

### API Specifications
**Inventory API Endpoints** [Source: Story 4.3 implementation]:
- `GET /inventory/items?medicationName={name}&pharmacyIds={ids}` - Query medication availability across pharmacies
- `GET /inventory/pharmacies?lat={lat}&lng={lng}&radius={km}` - Get nearby pharmacies with coordinates
- `GET /inventory/pharmacy/{pharmacyId}/items` - Get all inventory for specific pharmacy

**Map Integration Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/api-spec.md]:
- Google Maps JavaScript API integration for map rendering
- Geolocation API for user location detection
- Real-time inventory status updates via TanStack Query
- Pharmacy selection confirmation endpoint integration

### Component Specifications
**Map View Container** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- React component using TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Zustand for map state management (selected pharmacy, viewport)
- TanStack Query for inventory data fetching and caching

**Pharmacy Marker Component** [Source: Story 4.3 patterns]:
```typescript
interface PharmacyMarkerProps {
  pharmacy: MapPharmacyData;
  availability?: InventoryItem[];
  isSelected: boolean;
  onSelect: (pharmacyId: string) => void;
  onInfoWindowOpen: (pharmacyId: string) => void;
}
```

**Availability Status Component** [Source: Story 4.3 patterns]:
- Visual indicators for medication availability (in stock, low stock, out of stock)
- Real-time status updates with loading states
- Error handling for inventory API failures

### File Locations
**Frontend Components** [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]:
- `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/PharmacyMapView.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/PharmacyMarker.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/PharmacyInfoWindow.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/MedicationAvailabilityStatus.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/PharmacySelectionModal.tsx`

**Services and Hooks** [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]:
- `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/services/mapService.ts`
- `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/hooks/usePharmacyMap.ts`
- `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/hooks/usePharmacyAvailability.ts`

**Types and Interfaces** [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]:
- `packages/shared-types/src/pharmacy.types.ts` (extend existing)
- `packages/shared-types/src/map.types.ts` (new file)

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Vitest framework for component testing
- Mock Google Maps API for map component tests
- Mock inventory API for availability testing
- Test file location: `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/__tests__/`

**Integration Testing** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Test map integration with real inventory API
- Test pharmacy selection workflow
- Test error handling for API failures

**E2E Testing** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Playwright for complete pharmacy selection workflow
- Test map performance with multiple pharmacies
- Test mobile responsiveness of map interface

### Technical Constraints
**Performance Considerations** [Source: Story 4.3 patterns]:
- Implement map marker clustering for large numbers of pharmacies
- Use TanStack Query with 5-minute stale time for inventory data
- Add request debouncing for map viewport changes
- Implement lazy loading for pharmacy markers outside viewport

**Security Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/api-spec.md]:
- Secure Google Maps API key configuration
- User location privacy protection
- Rate limiting for inventory API calls
- Audit logging for pharmacy selections

**External API Integration** [Source: Story 4.3 patterns]:
- Google Maps JavaScript API for map rendering
- Geolocation API for user location detection
- Integration with existing pharmacy inventory APIs
- Follow established error handling and retry patterns

### Project Structure Notes
The implementation follows the established monorepo structure with clear separation between frontend and backend. The map view functionality will be integrated into the existing prescription workflow under `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/` following the established pattern. The map components will use the existing pharmacy inventory integration from Story 4.3, extending the current architecture with Google Maps integration. The implementation maintains consistency with existing React patterns, TanStack Query usage, and Tailwind CSS styling.
