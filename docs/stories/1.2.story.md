# Story 1.2: User Model & Database Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** System,
**I want** a secure database and a flexible user data model,
**so that** we can store information for all user roles using either an email or a phone number.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. NoSQL database (Firestore) provisioned
2. User model created with optional `email` and `phoneNumber` fields (one is required)
3. Backend service can connect to DB

  - [x] Configure Firebase project and enable Firestore
  - [x] Create Firestore security rules for user data access
  - [x] Initialize Firestore connection in Express.js backend
  - [x] Add Firebase Admin SDK to backend dependencies
- [x] Task 2: Create User data model and validation (AC: 2)
  - [x] Define User interface in packages/shared-types/src/index.ts

  - [x] Add createdAt timestamp and displayName fields
- [x] Task 3: Implement database connection and user operations (AC: 3)
  - [x] Create database service module in apps/api/src/features/
  - [x] Implement user CRUD operations (create, read, update)
  - [x] Add proper error handling for database operations
  - [x] Create database connection health check endpoint
- [x] Task 4: Unit testing for user model and database operations (AC: 1, 2, 3)

  - [x] Test error handling scenarios (network failures, invalid data)
  - [x] Mock Firestore for testing environment

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 completed the foundational scaffolding with proper monorepo structure, TypeScript configuration, and Express.js backend setup. The project is ready for feature development with all build tools and testing frameworks configured.

### Data Models
Based on the architecture documentation, the User model must be implemented with the following TypeScript interface [Source: architecture/data-models.md]:

```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  role: 'patient' | 'caregiver' | 'doctor' | 'pharmacist';
  email?: string;
  phoneNumber?: string;
  displayName: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

**Key Requirements:**
- Either `email` OR `phoneNumber` must be provided (not both required)
- Role field must be one of the four specified values
- UID should be generated by Firebase Auth system
- CreatedAt timestamp for audit purposes

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints are required for this story, but the database service will support future authentication endpoints [Source: architecture/api-spec.md]:
- `/auth/register` (future story)
- `/auth/login` (future story)

### Project Structure Integration
Files should be created following the established monorepo structure [Source: architecture/project-structure.md]:

**Backend Location:** `apps/api/src/features/` - for user database service
**Shared Types Location:** `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts` - for User interface
**Test Location:** `apps/api/src/features/` - for corresponding test files

### Technical Constraints
**Database:** Google Firestore (NoSQL) as specified in tech stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Authentication Integration:** Firebase Auth will provide uid values for user records [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Backend Framework:** Express.js with TypeScript running on Node.js ~20.x [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Security Considerations
- Firestore security rules must protect user data access
- Firebase Admin SDK provides secure server-side database access [Source: architecture/deployment.md]
- All API endpoints will be protected with token validation middleware (future implementation)

### Testing Standards
**Framework:** Vitest for unit and integration tests [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/deployment.md]
**Strategy:** Unit and Integration tests required for all code [Source: architecture/deployment.md]
**Test Location:** Co-locate test files with source code in same directory
**Mocking:** Use Firestore emulator or mocks for testing database operations
**Coverage:** Test all CRUD operations, validation logic, and error scenarios
