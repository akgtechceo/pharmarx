# Story 2.5: Order Payment

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.4 successfully completed the pharmacist verification system:
- Pharmacist approval flow now transitions orders from 'awaiting_verification' to 'awaiting_payment'
- Cost calculation is handled by pharmacists and stored in pharmacistReview.calculatedCost
- Order status management system is fully implemented and working
- Real-time queue updates and professional workflow patterns are established
- Strong foundation for payment processing integration with existing order management

### Data Models
**Payment Model** from architecture:
```typescript
interface Payment {
  paymentId: string;
  orderId: string;
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  gateway: 'mtn' | 'stripe' | 'paypal';
  transactionId: string;
  status: 'succeeded' | 'failed';
  receiptDetails: object; // For facture normalisée data
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#Payment Model]

**PrescriptionOrder Model** (relevant payment fields):
```typescript
interface PrescriptionOrder {
  orderId: string;
  patientProfileId: string;
  status: 'pending_verification' | 'awaiting_payment' | 'preparing' | 'out_for_delivery' | 'delivered' | 'rejected';
  cost: number;
  pharmacistReview?: {
    calculatedCost?: number;
    // ... other fields
  };
  // ... other fields
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#PrescriptionOrder Model]

### API Specifications
**Payment-related API endpoints** from architecture:
- `POST /orders/{orderId}/pay` - Process payment for an order
- `GET /orders/{orderId}/receipt` - Download compliant receipt
- `POST /orders/{orderId}/request-payment` - Generate payment link for third party
- `GET /public/pay/{paymentToken}` - Third-party payment interface
- `POST /public/pay/{paymentToken}` - Process third-party payment
- Payment webhook endpoints for each gateway: `/webhooks/stripe`, `/webhooks/paypal`, `/webhooks/mtn`
[Source: architecture/api-spec.md]

**Status Flow Management**:
- Current: 'awaiting_verification' → 'awaiting_payment' (from pharmacist approval)
- New: 'awaiting_payment' → 'paid' (after successful payment)
- Continue: 'paid' → 'preparing' (next epic workflow)

### Technical Constraints
**Payment Security Requirements**:
- Use Firebase Authentication token validation for all payment endpoints
- Implement secure payment tokenization (never store card details)
- Follow PCI compliance guidelines for payment data handling
- Use HTTPS for all payment communications
- Implement payment idempotency to prevent duplicate charges
[Source: architecture/deployment.md#security]

**Gateway Integration Requirements**:
- Stripe: Use Stripe Elements for secure card collection
- PayPal: Implement PayPal Checkout SDK for seamless experience
- MTN Mobile Money: Use MTN API with proper West African mobile payment flows
- All gateways must support webhook verification for payment confirmation
[Source: Epic 2 requirements, external API integration patterns]

**Receipt Compliance**:
- Must conform to "facture normalisée du Bénin" standard
- Include required tax information and regulatory data
- Generate PDF format for download and storage
- Support multiple languages (French/English) as per local requirements
[Source: AC 5, regional compliance requirements]

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** following established patterns:
- **Unit/Integration**: Vitest 1.6 for component and payment logic testing

**Required Test Scenarios**:
- Successful payment flows for each gateway (Stripe, PayPal, MTN)
- Payment failure scenarios and error recovery
- Receipt generation and download functionality
- Order status transitions during payment process
- Payment notification delivery and real-time updates

### Integration Points
**State Management**:
- Use TanStack Query 5.35 for payment status polling and server state
- Integrate with existing Zustand store for UI state management
