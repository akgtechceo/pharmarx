### Data Models
**PrescriptionOrder Interface** (shared across frontend/backend):
```typescript
interface PrescriptionOrder {
  orderId: string;
  patientProfileId: string;
  status: 'pending_verification' | 'awaiting_payment' | 'preparing' | 'out_for_delivery' | 'delivered' | 'rejected';
  originalImageUrl: string;
  medicationDetails: {
    name: string;
    dosage: string;
    quantity: number;
  };
  cost: number;  
  createdAt: Date;
}
```
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**Additional OCR-related fields** from Story 2.2 implementation:
- `extractedText: string` - Raw OCR output from Google Cloud Vision
- `ocrConfidence: number` - Overall confidence score (0-1) from Vision API
- `ocrStatus: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed'` - Processing status
- `lastProcessed: Date` - Timestamp of last OCR processing attempt
[Source: Story 2.2 implementation notes]

### API Specifications
**Relevant API endpoints** for verification workflow:
- `PUT /orders/{orderId}` - Update prescription order with verified data
- `GET /orders/{orderId}` - Retrieve order details including OCR results
- Status flow: 'pending_verification' → 'awaiting_payment' after verification
[Source: architecture/api-spec.md]

### Component Specifications  
**Frontend Architecture** requirements:
- **Framework**: React 18.3 with TypeScript 5.4 for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4 for rapid UI development
- **State Management**: TanStack Query 5.35 for server state, React hooks for local UI state
- **Component Location**: `apps/web/src/features/` for feature-specific components
- **Shared Types**: Import from `packages/shared-types` for consistency
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/project-structure.md]

### File Locations
Based on project structure, new verification components should be placed in:
```
apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/
├── components/
│   ├── PrescriptionVerification.tsx
│   ├── ExtractedDataForm.tsx
│   └── VerificationActions.tsx
├── hooks/
│   └── useOrderVerification.ts
└── types/
    └── verification.types.ts
```
[Source: architecture/project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** from architecture:
- **Unit/Integration**: Vitest 1.6 for all component and hook testing
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright 1.44 for critical user verification flows
- **Test Location**: `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/__tests__/`
- **Shared Types**: Test against actual TypeScript interfaces from packages/shared-types
- **Coverage**: Test both happy path (confirm) and skip workflows
[Source: architecture/deployment.md#testing-strategy]

### Technical Constraints
**Security and Performance**:
- All API endpoints protected with Firebase Authentication token validation
- Component must handle both successful OCR results and fallback scenarios
- Responsive design required for mobile/tablet prescription review
- Image display must be optimized for various prescription photo sizes
- Loading states required for all async operations (API calls)
[Source: architecture/deployment.md#security, Story 2.2 performance considerations]

### Project Structure Notes
Component placement aligns with monorepo structure:
- Frontend components in `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/`
- Shared TypeScript interfaces from `packages/shared-types/`
- No conflicts identified with existing project structure
[Source: architecture/project-structure.md verification]

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (Dev Agent James)

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive user verification system for extracted prescription data with side-by-side image/form layout, dual workflow options (Confirm/Skip), and complete integration with existing order management system.

### Architecture Decisions
- **Component Structure**: Modular approach with main PrescriptionVerification component, custom useOrderVerification hook, and dedicated types
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React hooks for local UI state, centralized error handling
- **Validation**: Client-side validation with real-time feedback, server-side validation through API integration
- **User Experience**: Loading states, error recovery, responsive design, accessibility compliance
- **Testing Strategy**: 3-tier testing (Unit, Integration, E2E) with comprehensive mocking and edge case coverage
