## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from Story 3.2 implementation:
- TanStack Query patterns with `refetchInterval` and `refetchIntervalInBackground` are the standard
- Service Layer Design patterns with clean method interfaces should be followed
- Shared types package ensures consistency across frontend/backend boundaries
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation is expected
- Excellent testing architecture with mocking strategies should be followed
- Real-time notification patterns established with polling every 15-30 seconds work excellently

### Data Models
**PrescriptionOrder Model** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#36]:
```typescript
interface PrescriptionOrder {
  orderId: string;
  patientProfileId: string;
  status: 'pending_verification' | 'awaiting_payment' | 'preparing' | 'out_for_delivery' | 'delivered' | 'rejected';
  originalImageUrl: string;
  medicationDetails: {
    name: string;
    dosage: string;
    quantity: number;
  };
  cost: number;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

**Payment Model** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#47]:
```typescript
interface Payment {
  paymentId: string;
  orderId: string;
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  gateway: 'mtn' | 'stripe' | 'paypal';
  transactionId: string;
  status: 'succeeded' | 'failed';
  receiptDetails: object; // For facture normalisée data
}
```

**Required New Data Models** [Source: Analysis of order history requirements]:
```typescript
interface OrderHistoryItem {
  orderId: string;
  status: PrescriptionOrder['status'];
  medicationDetails: PrescriptionOrder['medicationDetails'];
  cost: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  deliveredAt?: Date;
  hasReceipt: boolean;
}

interface OrderHistoryResponse {
  orders: OrderHistoryItem[];
  pagination: {
    page: number;
    limit: number;
    total: number;
    hasMore: boolean;
  };
}
```

### API Specifications
**Existing Order Endpoints** [Source: docs/architecture/api-spec.md#15]:
- Endpoint: `GET /orders` (existing, may need extension for history)
- Used for retrieving user's orders

**Required New API Endpoints** [Source: Order history requirements analysis]:
- Endpoint: `GET /orders/history?page={page}&limit={limit}`
- Response: OrderHistoryResponse with paginated order list
- Endpoint: `GET /orders/:orderId/receipt`
- Response: PDF receipt file for completed orders
- Authentication: Required for all endpoints

### Component Specifications
**Existing Order Components** [Source: Project structure analysis]:
- Located at `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/`
- OrderStatusDisplay component exists for individual order status
- Follow existing component patterns with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

**New OrderHistoryPage Component** [Source: Project structure analysis]:
- Location: `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/pages/OrderHistoryPage.tsx`
- Should display paginated list of past orders
- Include order status, dates, and download receipt functionality
- Follow existing page patterns with proper routing

**New ReceiptDownload Component** [Source: Project structure analysis]:
- Location: `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/ReceiptDownload.tsx`
- Should handle receipt generation and download
- Include loading states and error handling
- Follow existing component patterns

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]:
- **Frontend Pages**: 
  - `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/pages/OrderHistoryPage.tsx` (new page)
- **Frontend Components**: 
  - `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/ReceiptDownload.tsx` (new component)
- **Hooks**: 
  - `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/hooks/useOrderHistory.ts` (new hook)
- **Types**: `packages/shared-types/src/` (extend with order history types)
- **Backend Routes**: `apps/api/src/features/prescriptionOrderRoutes.ts` (extend existing)

### Testing Requirements
Following established patterns from previous stories:
- **Unit Tests**: Component testing with TanStack Query mocking
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing with order history data
- **E2E Tests**: Complete order history flow with Playwright
- **Test Files**: Co-located `.test.ts` files (e.g., `OrderHistoryPage.test.tsx`)
- **Mocking Strategies**: Mock order history API responses and receipt generation

### Technical Constraints
**Data Fetching** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#8]:
- Use TanStack Query for server state management
- Implement proper caching and background refetch patterns
- Handle pagination efficiently for large order lists

**Authentication** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#11]:
- Firebase Auth integration required for user context
- All API endpoints must verify user authentication
- User can only access their own order history

**Receipt Generation** [Source: Story 2.5 implementation]:
- Use existing receipt service for "facture normalisée du Bénin" compliance
- Receipts should be generated on-demand for completed orders
- Handle PDF generation and download properly

## QA Results

### Review Date: December 19, 2024
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation demonstrates excellent senior-level code quality with comprehensive feature coverage. The code follows established patterns from previous stories, uses proper TypeScript typing, and implements robust error handling. The architecture is well-designed with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `apps/api/src/features/prescriptionOrderRoutes.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed test mocking approach by replacing problematic `vi.doMock` calls with proper `vi.mocked(require())` pattern
  - **Why**: The original mocking approach was causing module resolution failures and test failures
  - **How**: This ensures tests can properly mock dependencies and validate the order history endpoints

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to TypeScript and Express.js best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper file organization following established patterns
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ Both acceptance criteria fully implemented with robust functionality

### Improvements Checklist
- [x] Fixed test mocking approach for order history endpoints (prescriptionOrderRoutes.test.ts)
- [x] Verified proper route registration and API endpoint functionality
- [x] Confirmed comprehensive error handling and validation
- [x] Validated pagination implementation and performance considerations
- [x] Checked receipt download functionality and security measures
- [ ] Address remaining test failures in SMS and WhatsApp services (unrelated to this story)
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for edge cases in order history pagination
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for large order history datasets

### Security Review
✅ **Excellent security implementation:**
- Proper authentication checks on all endpoints
- Patient data isolation (users can only access their own orders)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure file download with proper headers
- No sensitive data exposure in error messages

### Performance Considerations
✅ **Good performance practices implemented:**
- Efficient pagination with configurable limits (max 50 per page)
- Proper database indexing considerations
- TanStack Query caching with 5-minute stale time
- Background refetch every 30 seconds for real-time updates
- Optimized receipt generation (on-demand only)

### Final Status
✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

The implementation successfully delivers all acceptance criteria with high-quality code that follows established patterns and best practices. The order history feature is production-ready with comprehensive error handling, security measures, and performance optimizations. The minor test issues identified are unrelated to the core functionality and can be addressed separately.

### Key Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Feature Coverage**: All requirements from the story are fully implemented
2. **Excellent Code Architecture**: Follows established patterns and maintains consistency
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages
