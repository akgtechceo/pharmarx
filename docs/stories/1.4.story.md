# Story 1.4: User Login & Authentication

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** registered User,
**I want** to log in with my email or phone number and password,
**so that** I can access my account.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Login screen accepts email or phone number
2. Successful login generates a secure token and redirects to the correct role-based portal

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create login form component (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add form with email/phone toggle functionality
  - [x] Implement email/phone number validation
  - [x] Add password field with proper security attributes
  - [x] Create form submission handling
- [x] Implement authentication service logic (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create login API endpoint in backend
  - [x] Integrate with Firebase Auth for credential verification
  - [x] Handle authentication errors gracefully
- [x] Implement secure token generation and management (AC: 2)
  - [x] Generate Firebase ID tokens on successful login
  - [x] Store authentication state securely
  - [x] Implement token refresh mechanism
- [x] Create role-based portal routing (AC: 2)
  - [x] Add route guards for authenticated users
  - [x] Implement role-based redirection logic
  - [x] Create placeholder portal pages for each role
- [x] Add comprehensive testing (following Story 1.3 patterns)
  - [x] Unit tests for login component
  - [x] Unit tests for authentication service
  - [x] API endpoint testing
  - [x] E2E tests for complete login flow
  - [x] E2E tests for role-based redirection

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3 completed comprehensive multi-role registration system with excellent patterns established:
- Firebase Authentication integration with custom claims for role-based access control
- Email/phone flexibility patterns implemented and tested
- Secure backend API with Firebase token verification established
- Comprehensive testing patterns (unit + E2E) with Playwright
- Production-ready security with proper password hashing and input validation

### Data Models
User interface already established from previous stories:
```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  role: 'patient' | 'caregiver' | 'doctor' | 'pharmacist';
  email?: string;
  phoneNumber?: string;
  displayName: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

### API Specifications
Login endpoint defined in API specification:
- `POST /auth/login` - Log in a user
[Source: architecture/api-spec.md#paths]

### Component Specifications
Based on project structure, login components should be placed in:
- Frontend: `apps/web/src/features/auth/LoginPage.tsx`
- Components: `apps/web/src/components/LoginForm.tsx`
[Source: architecture/project-structure.md#project-structure]

### File Locations
Following established project structure:
- Backend API: `apps/api/src/features/authRoutes.ts` (extend existing)
- Frontend components: `apps/web/src/components/LoginForm.tsx`
- Authentication service: `apps/web/src/services/authenticationService.ts`
- Types: `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts` (extend existing)
- Tests: Co-located with components and services
[Source: architecture/project-structure.md#project-structure]

### Testing Requirements
Following patterns established in Story 1.3:
- Unit tests with Vitest framework for components and services
- API endpoint testing for backend
- Comprehensive E2E testing with Playwright
- Test files co-located with implementation files
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#testing]

### Technical Constraints
Technology stack requirements:
- TypeScript for type safety
- React with Vite for frontend
- Express.js backend
- Firebase Auth for authentication
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Security Requirements
Based on previous story implementation:
- Firebase ID token verification for API calls
- Secure token storage and refresh
- Input validation for login credentials
- Proper error handling without information leakage

### Project Structure Notes
All file locations align with the established monorepo structure. No structural conflicts identified between epic requirements and project architecture.

### Testing
**Test Standards:** Following Story 1.3 established patterns:
- **Test file location:** Co-located with implementation files (`.test.ts` suffix)
- **Test standards:** Unit tests for all components and services, integration tests for API endpoints
- **Testing frameworks:** Vitest for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- **Specific requirements:** Complete login flow E2E testing including role-based redirection, authentication state persistence testing

**Architecture Note:** No specific coding-standards.md or testing-strategy.md found in architecture docs - following patterns from previous completed stories.
