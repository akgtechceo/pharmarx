## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from Story 3.1 implementation:
- Real-time notification patterns established with polling every 15-30 seconds work excellently
- Service Layer Design patterns with clean method interfaces should be followed
- Shared types package ensures consistency across frontend/backend boundaries
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation is expected
- Excellent testing architecture with mocking strategies should be followed
- TanStack Query patterns with `refetchInterval` and `refetchIntervalInBackground` are the standard

### Data Models
**Order Status Values** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#36]:
```typescript
status: 'pending_verification' | 'awaiting_payment' | 'preparing' | 'out_for_delivery' | 'delivered' | 'rejected'
```
- Story will focus on 'out_for_delivery' status when delivery tracking is active
- Need to extend PrescriptionOrder model with delivery tracking fields

**Required New Data Models** [Source: Analysis of delivery tracking requirements]:
```typescript
interface DeliveryTrackingInfo {
  orderId: string;
  deliveryPersonId: string;
  currentLocation: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    timestamp: Date;
  };
  destinationLocation: {
    latitude: number;
    longitude: number;
    address: string;
  };
  estimatedArrival: Date;
  status: 'assigned' | 'picked_up' | 'in_transit' | 'approaching' | 'delivered';
  route?: {
    coordinates: Array<[number, number]>; // [lng, lat] format for mapping libraries
    distance: number; // in meters
    duration: number; // in seconds
  };
}
```

### API Specifications
**Existing Order Status Endpoint** [Source: apps/api/src/features/prescriptionOrderRoutes.ts#175]:
- Endpoint: `PUT /orders/:orderId/status` (existing, no changes needed)
- Used for updating order status to 'out_for_delivery'

**Required New API Endpoints** [Source: Delivery tracking requirements analysis]:
- Endpoint: `GET /orders/:orderId/delivery-tracking`
- Response: DeliveryTrackingInfo object with current location and ETA
- Endpoint: `POST /orders/:orderId/delivery-notifications` 
- For updating user notification preferences and handling proximity alerts

### Component Specifications
**Existing OrderStatusDisplay Component** [Source: Story 3.1 implementation]:
- Located at `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/OrderStatusDisplay.tsx`
- Currently shows order status progress with visual indicators
- Integration point for adding "Track Delivery" button when status is 'out_for_delivery'

**New DeliveryTracking Component** [Source: Project structure analysis]:
- Location: `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/DeliveryTracking.tsx`
- Should display map with delivery person location and route
- Include ETA display and proximity notifications
- Follow existing component patterns with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]:
- **Frontend Components**: 
  - `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/DeliveryTracking.tsx` (new main component)
  - `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/components/OrderStatusDisplay.tsx` (extend existing)
- **Hooks**: 
  - `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/hooks/useDeliveryTracking.ts` (new hook)
  - `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/hooks/useDeliveryNotifications.ts` (new hook)
  - `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/hooks/useOrderStatus.ts` (extend existing)
- **Pages**: `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/pages/DeliveryTrackingPage.tsx` (new page)
- **Types**: `packages/shared-types/src/` (extend with delivery tracking types)
- **Backend Routes**: `apps/api/src/features/deliveryTrackingRoutes.ts` (new routes file)

### Testing Requirements
Following established patterns [Source: Story 3.1 testing architecture]:
- **Unit Tests**: Component testing with map library mocking strategies
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing with geolocation mock data
- **E2E Tests**: Complete delivery tracking flow with Playwright
- **Test Files**: Co-located `.test.ts` files (e.g., `DeliveryTracking.test.tsx`)
- **Mocking Strategies**: Mock geolocation APIs, map libraries, and real-time location updates

### Technical Constraints
**Real-time Updates** [Source: apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/hooks/usePaymentNotification.ts#86]:
- Use existing polling mechanism with TanStack Query
- 15-30 second polling intervals established as standard for real-time location updates
- `refetchInterval` and `refetchIntervalInBackground` patterns to follow
- More frequent polling (10-15 seconds) may be needed for active delivery tracking

**Tech Stack Constraints** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: React 18.3 with TypeScript 5.4, Tailwind CSS for styling
- State Management: TanStack Query for server state, Zustand for global UI state
- Testing: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests
- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript, Google Firestore database

**Mapping Library Selection** [Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs]:
- Need to evaluate and select appropriate mapping solution (Google Maps, Leaflet, or Mapbox)
- Consider licensing costs, feature requirements, and integration complexity
- Should integrate well with React and TypeScript ecosystem

**Geolocation and Privacy** [Source: Browser API requirements analysis]:
- Require user permission for location access
- Implement fallback for users who deny location permissions
- Handle location accuracy and update frequency considerations
- Ensure privacy compliance for location data storage

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize map rendering and location update frequency to prevent excessive battery drain
- Implement efficient caching for route calculations and map tiles
- Use background polling strategies that don't impact user experience
- Consider service worker integration for location updates when app is backgrounded

### Project Structure Notes
The existing project structure aligns well with delivery tracking requirements:
- Feature-based organization in `apps/web/src/features/prescriptions/`
- Clear separation of components, hooks, pages, and services
- Shared types package for cross-application consistency
- Established patterns for real-time polling and notification systems

No structural conflicts identified. The delivery tracking feature fits naturally into the existing prescription order flow architecture.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Test File Locations** [Source: established patterns]:
- Unit tests: Co-located with components (e.g., `DeliveryTracking.test.tsx`)
- Integration tests: `apps/api/src/features/deliveryTrackingRoutes.test.ts` (new file)
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/delivery-tracking.spec.ts` (new file)

**Testing Frameworks and Patterns** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Unit Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for critical user flows
- **Mocking**: Comprehensive API and geolocation mocking strategies

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Test map component rendering with mocked geolocation data
- Mock mapping library (Google Maps/Leaflet) API calls for unit tests
- Test real-time location polling with various update scenarios
- E2E test for complete delivery tracking user experience from order status to arrival notification
- Test notification system triggers for approach and arrival alerts
- Test error handling for location permission denied and network failures
