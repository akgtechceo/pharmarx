## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Key learnings from Story 3.3 implementation:
- TanStack Query patterns with `refetchInterval` and `refetchIntervalInBackground` are the standard
- Service Layer Design patterns with clean method interfaces should be followed
- Shared types package ensures consistency across frontend/backend boundaries
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation is expected
- Excellent testing architecture with mocking strategies should be followed
- Real-time notification patterns established with polling every 15-30 seconds work excellently
- Portal-based architecture with role-specific components is well established

### Data Models
**User Model** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#1]:
```typescript
interface User {
  uid: string;
  role: 'patient' | 'caregiver' | 'doctor' | 'pharmacist';
  email?: string;
  phoneNumber?: string;
  displayName: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}
```

**PatientProfile Model** [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#12]:
```typescript
interface PatientProfile {
  profileId: string;
  managedByUid: string;
  patientName: string;
  dateOfBirth: Date;
  insuranceDetails?: {
    provider: string;
    policyNumber: string;
  };
}
```

**Required New Data Models** [Source: Analysis of caregiver profile management requirements]:
```typescript
interface ProfileManagementResponse {
  profiles: PatientProfile[];
  activeProfileId?: string;
}

interface CreateProfileRequest {
  patientName: string;
  dateOfBirth: string; // ISO date string
  insuranceDetails?: {
    provider: string;
    policyNumber: string;
  };
}

interface UpdateProfileRequest {
  patientName?: string;
  dateOfBirth?: string;
  insuranceDetails?: {
    provider: string;
    policyNumber: string;
  };
}
```

### API Specifications
**Profile Management Endpoints** [Source: Analysis of caregiver requirements]:
- `POST /api/profiles` - Create new patient profile for caregiver
- `GET /api/profiles` - Get all profiles managed by authenticated caregiver
- `PUT /api/profiles/:profileId` - Update specific profile details
- `DELETE /api/profiles/:profileId` - Remove profile (with validation)
- `GET /api/profiles/active` - Get currently active profile for caregiver

**Authentication Requirements** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- All endpoints require Firebase Auth token validation
- Caregivers can only access profiles they manage (managedByUid === user.uid)
- Profile operations must validate caregiver ownership before allowing changes

### Component Specifications
**ProfileSelector Component** [Source: Analysis of UI requirements]:
```typescript
interface ProfileSelectorProps {
  profiles: PatientProfile[];
  activeProfileId?: string;
  onProfileSelect: (profileId: string) => void;
  onAddProfile: () => void;
  onEditProfile: (profileId: string) => void;
}
```

**AddProfileModal Component** [Source: Analysis of UI requirements]:
```typescript
interface AddProfileModalProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  onSubmit: (profileData: CreateProfileRequest) => Promise<void>;
}
```

**ProfileCard Component** [Source: Analysis of UI requirements]:
```typescript
interface ProfileCardProps {
  profile: PatientProfile;
  isActive: boolean;
  onSelect: () => void;
  onEdit: () => void;
  onDelete: () => void;
}
```

### File Locations
**Backend Files** [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]:
- `apps/api/src/features/profileRoutes.ts` - Profile management API endpoints
- `apps/api/src/features/profileRoutes.test.ts` - API endpoint tests
- `packages/shared-types/src/index.ts` - Add new profile-related types

**Frontend Files** [Source: docs/architecture/project-structure.md]:
- `apps/web/src/features/profiles/components/ProfileSelector.tsx` - Profile selection component
- `apps/web/src/features/profiles/components/AddProfileModal.tsx` - Add profile modal
- `apps/web/src/features/profiles/components/ProfileCard.tsx` - Profile display card
- `apps/web/src/features/profiles/components/ProfileEditModal.tsx` - Edit profile modal
- `apps/web/src/features/profiles/hooks/usePatientProfiles.ts` - Profile data management
- `apps/web/src/features/profiles/hooks/useProfileSelector.ts` - Active profile context
- `apps/web/src/features/profiles/pages/ProfileManagementPage.tsx` - Profile management page
- `apps/web/src/components/portals/CaregiverPortal.tsx` - Update to include profile selector

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Use Vitest for unit and integration testing
- Use Playwright for E2E testing
- Test files should be co-located with components: `ComponentName.test.tsx`
- E2E tests should be in `e2e/` directory: `profile-management.spec.ts`

**Testing Patterns** [Source: Previous story implementations]:
- Mock TanStack Query responses for isolated component testing
- Test API endpoints with proper authentication mocking
- Include error handling scenarios in all tests
- Test responsive design with mobile viewport sizes
- Validate accessibility with proper ARIA attributes

### Technical Constraints
**Frontend Framework** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- React 18.3 with TypeScript 5.4
- Tailwind CSS 3.4 for styling
- Zustand 4.5 for global state management
- TanStack Query 5.35 for server state management

**Backend Framework** [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Express.js 4.19 with TypeScript 5.4
- Firebase Auth for authentication
- Google Firestore for database storage

**Performance Considerations** [Source: Previous story patterns]:
- Implement proper caching with TanStack Query (5-minute stale time)
- Background refetch every 30 seconds for real-time updates
- Optimistic updates for profile switching
- Debounced search for profile filtering

### Project Structure Notes
The implementation follows the established monorepo structure with clear separation between frontend and backend. Profile management will be a new feature module under `apps/web/src/features/profiles/` following the existing pattern established by the prescriptions feature. The backend will add new routes under `apps/api/src/features/profileRoutes.ts` following the established Express.js patterns.
