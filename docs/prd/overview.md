## Goals and Background Context

#### **Goals**
* Become the leading prescription delivery platform in Cotonou, Benin, with a plan for regional expansion.
* Build a sustainable and profitable revenue model.
* Improve medication adherence and health outcomes by simplifying access to medicine.
* Significantly reduce the time, stress, and logistical complexity for users managing prescriptions.

#### **Background Context**
This project addresses the critical need for a modern, reliable prescription fulfillment service in French-speaking West Africa. The current process, reliant on in-person pharmacy visits, poses significant challenges for busy professionals, patients with mobility issues, and caregivers. Our platform will provide a unified, secure, and user-friendly web and mobile application to solve this problem, creating a new standard for convenient access to healthcare in the region.
